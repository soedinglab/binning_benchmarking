### Snakemake workflow for benchmarking binning of pooled assembly contigs

Create a snakemake environment (preferrably using conda, https://anaconda.org/bioconda/snakemake) to run snakemake pipeline. To reproduce the results, install binning tools assessed here namely (McDevol, VAMB, COMEBin, GenomeFace and MetaBAT2) in your system as instructed in their respective github repositories or use `.yml` files in environment folder for the conda environments used in this study.
